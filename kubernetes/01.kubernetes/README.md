# Kubernetes

Kubernetes, also known as ```k8s```, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Kubernetes automates operational tasks of container management and includes built-in commands for deploying applications,
rolling out changes to your applications, scaling your applications up and down to fit changing needs,
monitoring your applications, and moreâ€”making it easier to manage applications.
