# Blue & Green Deployment

Blue Green is a deployment pattern that reduces downtime by running two identical production environments
called blue and green. Only one environment lives at a time.

There are a few other considerations to keep in mind when using Blue-Green Deployment in Kubernetes:

1. Storage: If your application requires persistent storage, you will need to ensure that both the blue and green deployments are using the same persistent volume. Otherwise, you may lose data during the deployment process.
2. DNS: If you are using a custom domain name for your application, you will need to update the DNS records to point to the new IP address when switching from the blue to the green deployment.
3. Testing: Before switching traffic to the green deployment, it is essential to thoroughly test the new version of the application to ensure that it is working correctly. You can use canary deployments to gradually shift traffic to the new version of the application and monitor its performance.

While Blue-Green Deployment can be an effective way to deploy applications, it may not be the best choice for every situation. For example, if your application requires a lot of data migration or database schema changes, Blue-Green Deployment may not be the best strategy, as it can lead to data inconsistencies between the blue and green environments.

In addition, Blue-Green Deployment can be challenging to implement for stateful applications that require persistent storage, as the data must be synchronized between the blue and green environments. In these cases, you may need to consider other deployment strategies, such as rolling updates or canary deployments.
